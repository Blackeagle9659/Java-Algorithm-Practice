# Prime Number Finder (Java)

This repository contains basic algorithm studies developed during my Computer Engineering / AI Engineering degree.

## 🚀 Project Description
A simple yet efficient Java program that identifies prime numbers within a specified range (0-100). The main goal of this project is to understand **nested loops**, **boolean flags**, and **flow control** mechanisms in Java.

## 🛠️ Technical Details & Logic
The algorithm follows a brute-force approach with optimization:

* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts:** `for-loops`, `if-else conditions`, `break statement`.

### How it Works:
1.  **Iteration:** The program iterates through numbers from 2 to 100 using a primary loop.
2.  **Assumption:** Every number is initially assumed to be prime (`isPrime = true`).
3.  **Verification:** A nested loop checks if the current number is divisible by any integer smaller than itself.
4.  **Optimization:** If a divisor is found, the inner loop terminates immediately using the `break` keyword to save computational resources (CPU cycles).
